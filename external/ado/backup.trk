d 'WINSOR': module to Winsorize a variable
d 
d winsor takes the non-missing values of a variable and generates a
d new variable  identical except that the h highest and h lowest
d values are replaced by the  next value counting inwards from the
d extremes. h can be specified directly or  indirectly by
d specifying a fraction p of the number of observations: h =  [p
d n]. This transformation is named after the biostatistician C.P.
d Winsor. This is version 1.3.0 of  the software.

d 'OUTREG2': module to arrange regression outputs into an illustrative table
d 
d  outreg2 provides a fast and easy way to produce an illustrative
d table  of regression outputs. The regression outputs are produced
d piecemeal and are  difficult to compare without some type of
d rearrangement. outreg2  automates this process by concatenating
d the successive regression outputs in a  vertical format. The
d resulting table is saved to the disk in ASCII  format, which can
d be read by other programs. outreg2 thus facilitates  the
d convertion of regression outputs to a standard format suitable
d for  inclusion in a scholarly publication. The functionality of
d outreg2 is based on the earlier package outreg,  by John Luke
d Gallup. Unlike outreg, outreg2 is capable of writing LaTeX-format
d tables, as well as ASCII, MS Word and MS Excel.

d 'ESTOUT': module to make regression tables
d 
d  estout produces a table of regression results from one or

d word-processor table. eststo stores a quick copy of the active
d estimation results for later tabulation. esttab is a wrapper for
d estout. It displays a pretty looking publication-style regression
d table without much typing. estadd adds additional results to the
d e()-returns for one or several models previously fitted and
d stored. This package subsumes the previously circulated esto,
d esta, estadd,  and estadd_plus. An earlier version of estout is
d available  as estout1.

d 'BINSCATTER': module to generate binned scatterplots
d 
d  binscatter generates binned scatterplots, and is optimized for
d speed in large  datasets.  Binned scatterplots provide a
d non-parametric way of visualizing the relationship between two
d variables.  With a large number of observations, a scatterplot
d that plots every data point would become too crowded to interpret
d visually.  binscatter groups the x-axis variable into equal-sized
d bins, computes the mean of the x-axis and y-axis variables within
d each bin, then creates a scatterplot of these data points.  It
d provides built-in options to control for covariates before
d plotting the relationship.  It will also plot fit lines based on
d the underlying data, and can automatically handle regression
d discontinuities.
